## Domain: Sports & Entertainment | Function: Research Analytics

"Business Basics," a leading business magazine, is preparing a special edition on the dual impact of the Indian Premier League 2025. With over 50% of advertisements during the tournament coming from fantasy gaming apps and pan masala brands, the edition will explore both the economic growth driven by IPL and the social/health implications of such advertising.

The analysis goes beyond cricket statistics, examining:

    IPL’s contribution to India’s economy

    Advertising patterns & brand categories

    Potential health & social concerns tied to ad content

Using unstructured data sourced through tools like Perplexity, the study provides a balanced view for informed public discourse.
